# Weather App Project

This is a simple weather application built with **Kotlin**, **Ktor**, and **JavaScript**. The app fetches real-time weather data and displays it on a web interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** - A modern, expressive programming language used for the backend.
- **Ktor** - A lightweight web framework for Kotlin, used to build the backend server.
- **HTML** & **CSS** - Used for structuring and styling the frontend of the application.

## Features

- The app fetches weather data for a given location (`Berkeley Heights` in this case) from an external API (`wttr.in`).
- The frontend displays a button that, when clicked, fetches weather information and shows it on the page.
- The backend is built using Ktor and exposes a `/weather` endpoint that returns the weather data.
